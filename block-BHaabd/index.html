                    The Shire is currently the largest horse breed in the world, and it’s known for its tall, muscular build and feathered legs. It is also one of the horses with an easy-going temperament.

This breed is typically bay, grey, black, brown, or chestnut. It has an interesting history, the most notable being pulling giant carts of ale from breweries to homes. But it has served many other purposes including farming, riding, and fighting at battlefields.

Even in modern times, farmers with small farms are finding this breed of horses a better eco-friendly alternative to tractors.

Perhaps one of the reasons Shire horses are used to perform heavy tasks is that they historically rank among the strongest breeds. In the 1920s two Shires are said to have transported a load weighing more than 40 tons!

However, due to the ever-increasing mechanization of transportation equipment, people have turned to the more modernized means of carriage, which has resulted in the number of Shire horses decreasing significantly.

But thanks to organizations like the American Shire Horse Association, there is hope for this almost extinct breed of horses. Due to their effort, Shire horses are slowly starting to make a comeback.
